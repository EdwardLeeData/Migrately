# Migrately

Migrately simplifies the U.S. visa and immigration journey by combining the power of community and technology. A new easy to use process that matches and customizes the right U.S. travel, visa, and immigration process. 

Migrately is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the checkout feature.
